            <h2>Madison Beer Brings Sensuous 'Baby' To 2020 MTV EMAs</h2>
            <p>Madison Beer represented America at the 2020 MTV EMAs on Sunday (Nov. 8), bringing "Baby" from her upcoming studio debut Life Support to the socially distanced awards show. Dressed in black with a lengthy trench coat trailing behind her, Beer strutted through a moody, hazy set as she sang the sultry, self-assured pop jam.
                The day prior to the EMAs, Beer shared her joy over Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' 2020 election victory, tweeting "millions of young girls will now be able to look to the white house, for the first time in history, & see themselves. they will look at you Kamala, knowing they can do & be anything. our first female, first black, & first asian american vp. this is a glorious day in history."<br/>

            <h2>Maluma Performs 'Hawai' & Joins Aya Nakamura for 'Djadja' at 2020 MTV EMA</h2>
            <p>Maluma released his Papi Juancho album in August, but for his first song at Sunday's (Nov. 8) MTV Europe Music Awards, he gave shine to another artist: trading verses with French pop singer Aya Nakamura on a remix of her international hit "Djadja."
                The duo were in separate places, with the Colombian superstar in a blue-and-pink-lit modern apartment looking at Nakamura on a TV screen. But Maluma was hardly alone: He was joined by a bevy of masked dancers slinking around him.<br/>

            <h2>Zara Larsson Stuns With 'Wow' Performance at the 2020 EMAs</h2>
            <p>Swedish pop star Zara Larsson took the remote stage at the 2020 MTV Europe Music Awards for a captivating performance of her most recent single, "Wow."
                Wearing an all-black outfit with a crop top bra, gloves with long sleeves and high-heeled boots, Larsson began the performance with a long a cappella vocal showcase. Once the beat kicked in, she was joined by backup dancers, leading them in an impressively choreographed performance that might, as the song proclaims, make your jaw drop.<br/>
